A modern, production-ready dashboard for monitoring Coolify applications, services, and databases with comprehensive multi-language support.

## Quick Start

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker pull torukobyte/coolify-dashboard:latest

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  --name coolify-dashboard \
  -e "ADMIN_USERNAME=admin" \
  -e "ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password" \
  -e "ADMIN_2FA_SECRET=your_2fa_secret_key" \
  -e "JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key" \
  -e "ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr" \
  -e "COOLIFY_BASE_URL=https://coolify.kalayciburak.com.tr" \
  -e "COOLIFY_TOKEN=your_coolify_api_token" \
  -e "DASHBOARD_USER_TYPE=admin" \
  torukobyte/coolify-dashboard:latest
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Installation on Coolify

### Step 1: Create New Application

Navigate to your Coolify instance and create a new application:

- Click **"Add New"** in the Coolify dashboard
- Select **"Docker Image"** as the deployment type
- Enter image name: `torukobyte/coolify-dashboard:latest`

### Step 2: General Configuration

Configure the basic settings:

- **Domain**: `dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr`
- **Port**: `5000`
- Configure network and storage settings as needed

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Set the following required environment variables:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
ADMIN_2FA_SECRET=your_2fa_secret_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr
COOLIFY_BASE_URL=https://coolify.kalayciburak.com.tr
COOLIFY_TOKEN=your_coolify_api_token
DASHBOARD_USER_TYPE=admin
```

### Step 4: Generate 2FA Secret

Generate a secure 2FA secret for authentication:

```bash
# If running locally
cd server
npm run generate-2fa

# If using Docker, generate manually:
node -e "console.log(require('speakeasy').generateSecret({length: 32}).base32)"
```

Copy the generated secret and use it as `ADMIN_2FA_SECRET` in your environment variables.

### Step 5: Generate Coolify API Token

**Important**: Before deploying, generate your Coolify API token with proper permissions based on your user type:

#### For Viewer Mode (Read-Only Access)
1. Navigate to your Coolify instance settings
2. Go to **API Tokens** section
3. Click **"Create New Token"**
4. Select the following permissions:
   - **read**: Enable all read permissions
   - **read:sensitive**: Enable sensitive data read access
5. Copy the generated token and use it as `COOLIFY_TOKEN`
6. Set `DASHBOARD_USER_TYPE=viewer` in environment variables

**Note**: The `read:sensitive` permission is required to access detailed resource information, including environment variables and sensitive configuration data.

#### For Admin Mode (Full Control)
1. Navigate to your Coolify instance settings
2. Go to **API Tokens** section
3. Click **"Create New Token"**
4. Select the following permissions:
   - **write**: Enable all write permissions (includes read access)
5. Copy the generated token and use it as `COOLIFY_TOKEN`
6. Set `DASHBOARD_USER_TYPE=admin` in environment variables

**Note**: The `write` permission is **required** for admin features, which include:
- Starting and stopping services
- Deleting services
- Viewing live service logs with filtering
- All read operations available in viewer mode

**Warning**: Only use admin mode with users you trust, as it grants full control over your Coolify services.

### Step 6: Setup 2FA (One-Time Only)

After deployment, setup Two-Factor Authentication. **This can only be done once!**

1. Check if setup is available:
   ```bash
   curl https://dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr/api/auth/2fa/status
   # Response: {"setupCompleted": false, "canSetup": true}
   ```

2. Send a POST request to `/api/auth/2fa/setup` with your admin credentials:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr/api/auth/2fa/setup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your_password"}'
   ```

2. The response will include a QR code in the `qrCode` field. To view it:
   - Copy the entire `qrCode` value (starts with `data:image/png;base64,...`)
   - Paste it into your browser's URL bar
   - Press Enter to display the QR code image

3. Scan the displayed QR code with an authenticator app:
   - **Google Authenticator** (iOS/Android)
   - **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS/Android) - Shows logo
   - **Authy** (iOS/Android/Desktop) - Shows logo
   - **1Password** (Premium feature)

4. Save the secret in a secure location as backup

### Resetting/Regenerating 2FA

If you need to reset or regenerate your 2FA setup (e.g., lost authenticator app access, compromised secret, or want to use a different device), follow these steps:

#### Why Manual Reset?

The dashboard **does not** provide a UI for resetting 2FA for security reasons. This prevents unauthorized users from regenerating 2FA codes even if they gain access to your dashboard. The reset process requires server-level access, ensuring maximum security.

#### Reset Process

**1. Stop the Application**

First, stop your running application:

```bash
# If running locally
npm stop

# If using Docker
docker stop coolify-dashboard

# If on Coolify
# Use Coolify UI to stop the application
```

**2. Delete the 2FA State File**

This file tracks whether 2FA setup has been completed:

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Delete the state file
rm .2fa-state.json

# If using Docker/Coolify, access the container:
docker exec -it coolify-dashboard rm /app/server/.2fa-state.json
```

**3. Generate a New 2FA Secret**

Create a new secret key:

```bash
# If running locally
cd server
npm run generate-2fa

# If using Docker, generate manually:
node -e "console.log(require('speakeasy').generateSecret({length: 32}).base32)"
```

Copy the generated secret (it looks like: `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)

**4. Update Environment Variables**

Update your `.env` file or environment configuration:

```env
ADMIN_2FA_SECRET=YOUR_NEW_SECRET_HERE
```

**On Coolify:**
1. Go to your application settings
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Update `ADMIN_2FA_SECRET` with the new value
4. Save changes

**5. Restart the Application**

```bash
# If running locally
npm run dev

# If using Docker
docker restart coolify-dashboard

# If on Coolify
# Use Coolify UI to restart/deploy the application
```

**6. Setup 2FA Again**

After restart, follow [Step 6](#step-6-setup-2fa-one-time-only) to complete the new 2FA setup:

```bash
curl -X POST https://dashboard.kalayciburak.com.tr/api/auth/2fa/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your_password"}'
```

Scan the new QR code with your authenticator app.

**7. Remove Old Entry from Authenticator App**

**Important**: Don't forget to delete the old "Coolify Dashboard" entry from your authenticator app, as it will no longer work with the new secret.

| 1 | Stop Application | `docker stop coolify-dashboard` or Coolify UI |

## Motivation

While using Coolify, I found myself constantly clicking through each application and service individually just to view their URLs and basic information. This repetitive process became tedious when managing multiple resources. I thought, "Why not build a simple, elegant solution that displays everything at a glance?" This dashboard was born from that need—a centralized view to monitor all resources efficiently. If others find it useful too, that's even better.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalayciburak/coolify-dashboard.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd coolify-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create server/.env file with required variables
# See "Environment Variables" section below for all options

# Start development server (with 2FA disabled)
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
```

### Development Mode (2FA Bypass)

For easier local development, you can disable Two-Factor Authentication by setting `NODE_ENV=development`:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NODE_ENV="development"; npm run dev

# Windows (CMD)
set NODE_ENV=development && npm run dev
```

**Important Notes:**
- 2FA is **automatically disabled** when `NODE_ENV=development` is set
- In production, **never** set `NODE_ENV=development` as this bypasses 2FA security
- Without `NODE_ENV=development`, 2FA is always required (default production behavior)
- You can also add `NODE_ENV=development` to your `server/.env` file for persistent dev mode
